### Hi, I'm Kacper!
📚 I'm a Geoinformatics student at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, with a growing passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

🌱 As a beginner developer, I’m on an exciting journey to master new technologies and build impactful solutions. Currently, I’m working on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project with PDF document integration, combining innovation and problem-solving.

💡 My skill set includes:
- Python programming with a focus on AI/ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
- Data preprocessing and visualization techniques.
- Practical experience with version control systems (Git/GitHub).
🤝 I’m eager to collaborate on AI and ML projects, learn from others, and contribute to the tech community. If you're looking for a motivated and curious partner for your next project, let’s connect!

🔗 Let’s build the future together:
